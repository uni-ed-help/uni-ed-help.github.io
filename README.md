# Uni(ED)Help
Do you need help? Here's University &amp; Educational Help: the ultimate academic guide for teens

**Mission Statement**
We are a tri-state based non-profit organization focused on providing a means for teens to discover new interests and passions in STEM while receiving free guidance throughout their transition from high school to university.

**Formulation of Our Idea**
Throughout our time in high school, we were required to scour the internet in order to find any opportunities in STEM or otherwise. We also had no idea of how to handle the college application process, including how to find the perfect college or when to  start studying for the many tests that we have taken. Through the encouragement to create LinkedIn accounts, we have all experienced the disappointment of only receiving job recommendations from employers looking for undergraduate or graduate students. As a collective group, we came to the consensus that opportunities and resources for high schoolers interested in STEM and furthering their career are hard to come by.

**Languages Used**
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript

**Challenges We Encountered**
Our major challenges included: 
* Creating the resume builder due to the unexpected difficulties involved in using back-end Python and the github servers. To overcome this, we jumped into learning and utilizing javascript instead, a language which none of us had really touched before
* Pushing and pulling using GitHub. Many times, our code was overridden although we had made sure that our code was updated.

**Features in the Future**
* Log-In Factor in combination with AI system: analyzes prior search history to make user experience more personalized.
* Automate User-Questions: uses a database to add user-questions onto the FAQ page automatically.
* Monetization: reaches out to sponsors and donors for monetary support and opportunities.
