    <button class="accordion">&#8226; How do I get into college? How do I prepare?</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>
        Most students begin to prepare for college in their freshman year of high school, and this is probably the best time to start. Colleges consider a number of attributes prior to making a decision about a student's application.

    <button class="accordion">&#8226; When should I start studying for the SAT/ACT and which should I take?</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>
        Most students start studying for their SAT/ACT tests during the summer before their sophomore or junior year. This will allow them to take at least one test and to be able to see their scores before deciding whether or not to take the test again.
        <br> <br>
        You should also decide which test you would actually like to take. Over the years, the content of the SAT has become more like that of the ACT, but there are still many differences.
        <br> <br>
        Here are some of the key differences between the SAT and ACT:

    <button class="accordion">&#8226; How should I study for the SAT Subject Tests?</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>
        Subject tests test your proficiency in a certain subject, such as Chemistry, Physics, or Mathematics. You are able to choose as many Subject Tests as you want to take, but you may only take three in a single sitting. Many students take a regular or AP Course and study simultaneously, as school courses are often harder than the actual SAT Subject Tests.
        <br> <br>
        Here is a basic timeline for studying for the SAT II:
        <ol>
          <li> Take an <b>initial practice test</b>, either from online or from a workbook. </li>
          <li> Based on your score on the practice test, decide how much time you would like to allot towards studying, and create a <b>study plan</b>. Make sure to allow enough time before your test date. </li>
          <li> If you have not found a <b>preparatory workbook</b>, find one that you can use for review. Books by the Princeton Review, Barron's, or CollegeBoard itself are perfect for studying. </li>
          <li> Begin <b>studying and reviewing</b> for your chosen Subject Test. </li>
        </ol>

    <button class="accordion">&#8226; What colleges should I apply to?</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>
        Before choosing colleges and universities that you want to apply to based on their name brand or overall ranking, you need to find out what exactly do you want as a college experience. Do you still want to be able to see your family, or do you want to be far, far away? Would you want a large school or a small one?
        <br><br>
        Here is a list of things that you may want to consider:
        <ul>
          <li> <b> Campus Environment </b> (Student life, dorms, extracurriculars.) </li>
          <li> <b> Curriculum </b> (Core curriculum like Columbia, or open like Brown?) </li>
          <li> <b> Faculty </b> (Student to Faculty ratio, access to professors and research opportunities.) </li>
          <li> <b> Geographic location </b> (Close to home v.s. far from home, culture, weather.)</li>
          <li> <b> Majors </b> (Is your major offered at the college?) </li>
          <li> <b> Overall cost </b> (Consider financial aid and scholarships.) </li>
          <li> <b> Quality of education </b> (Statistics: how many graduates actually find jobs? What is the average salary?) </li>
          <li> <b> Rate of Admission </b> (What percentage of applicants do they accept?) </li>
          <li> <b> Type/size of school </b> (Liberal arts v.s. STEM, large v.s. small.)</li>
        </ul>
        After considering these options, you will be able to use websites such as <a href="https://www.naviance.com/">Naviance</a> and <a href="https://collegeboard.org">CollegeBoard</a> to discover the colleges that fit your interests and personality.
