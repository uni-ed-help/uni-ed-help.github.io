            <p> Sarah, a senior at Leon M. Goldstein High School in Brooklyn, NY, has always been intrigued with the fields of computer
              science, aerospace engineering, biology, and chemistry. While tackling numerous college-level/advanced science and math
              courses, she realized that these fields are largely male dominated. Passionate about defying the gender gap in technology,
              Sarah participated in the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program 2019, where she forged relationships with like-minded
              young women. Wanting to learn more about computer science applications in a corporate setting, Goldman Sachs provided a
              unique environment for Sarah to pitch and complete projects in the languages of Python, HTML,
              CSS, Javascript, and C and to communicate with real analysts in the technology sector. Outside the world of
              computer sccience, Sarah takes pride in involving herself widely in her school's community and in numerous activities
              outside her school. As Vice-President of the Senior Council, President of the Neuroscience Club, and photographer for the
              school yearbook, Sarah learns valuable leadership skills. As partio he Science Olympiad team annd competing in various regional
              competitions she learned how to utilize her building skills to complete in engineering events. </p>
