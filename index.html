            <p> 
              Sarah, a senior at Leon M. Goldstein High School in Brooklyn, NY, has always been intrigued with the fields of computer science, aerospace engineering, biology, and chemistry. While tackling college-level STEM courses, she realized that these fields are largely male dominated. Passionate about defying the gender gap in technology, Sarah participated in the Girls Who Code SIP 2019, where she forged relationships with like-minded young women. Eager to learn about technological applications in a corporate setting, Goldman Sachs provided a unique environment to pitch ideas and complete projects in the languages of Python, HTML, CSS, Javascript, and C. Additionally, as Vice-president of the Senior Council, Neuroscience Club President, and school yearbook photographer, Sarah learns valuable leadership skills. As a part of the Science Olympiad team, she learned various building skills to compete in engineering events. Not forgetting her passion for the arts, Sarah is also the concertmaster of her community orchestra and knows 3 languages.             <a href = 'https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarah-fida-ba489a18b/'><i class = 'fa fa-linkedin'style= 'color:black'></i></a>
