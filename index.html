            <p> Sarah, a senior at Leon M. Goldstein High School in Brooklyn, NY, has always been intrigued with the fields of computer science, aerospace engineering, biology, and chemistry. While tackling numerous college-level/advanced science and math courses, she realized that these fields are largely male dominated. Passionate about defying the gender gap in technology, Sarah participated in the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program 2019, where she forged relationships with like-minded young women. Wanting to learn about computer science applications in a corporate setting, Goldman Sachs provided a unique environment for Sarah to pitch and complete projects in the languages of Python, HTML, CSS, Javascript, and C and to communicate with real analysts in the technology sector. Outside the world of computer science, Sarah takes pride in involving herself widely in her school’s community and in numerous activities outside of her school. As Vice-president of the Senior Council, President of the Neuroscience Club, and photographer for the school yearbook, Sarah learns valuable leadership skills. As a part of the Science Olympiad team and competing in various regional competitions, she learned how to utilize her building skills to compete in engineering events. Not forgetting her passion for the arts, Sarah is the concertmaster of her community orchestra and knows 3 languages.
